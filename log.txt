I apologize but I did not document exact times. I've have been 
struggling tremendously with this class and have fallen on tough 
times. I will continue giving my best effort but I do not 
understand a lot of the material.  I am half way through this 
post-bacc program and I've hit a mental wall. I put in about 20 
hours over the weekend and about 8 hours throughout the week
 studying but I fell very short of expectations.  This will be the
  first class, since starting this program, that I am failing.  I 
 apologize for not understanding the level of content being taught
 I will take time this upcoming week to seek additional help.
